	Document a little in comments in templates.
	Change code editor to put methods in separate categories (at some
	point we should use separate files for faster compilation when only
	one method has changed).
	Fix coordinate mapping to find views on main document windows.
	Add code to detect which part of a scroller is hit, and alter the
	inspector to select it.

	* Resources/ThemeDocument.gorm: Change the window so that it's
	not resizable.   Also add some more widgets to the document.
