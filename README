This is a theme editor for GNUstep.  It is at an early stage of development ...

Theming has to be built into the GNUstep GUI in order for a theme editor
to be useful ... this will be an incremental process, with capabilities
being added to the editor as they are added to the gui library.

Building the current editor requires the *latest* version of the
theme branch of the GUI from SVN.

Current capabilities are ...

1. control of system colors
2. control of system images
3. control of menu and window user defaults

In future the aim is to have 

4. Drawing controls by tiling images ...
the editor will let you define the tiles.
5. Implementing new methods to draw controls ...
the editor will let you code and test those methods.
