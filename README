This is a theme editor for GNUstep.  It is at an early stage of development ...

Theming has to be built into the GNUstep GUI in order for a theme editor
to be useful ... this will be an incremental process, with capabilities
being added to the editor as they are added to the gui library.

The editor is already capable of building simple themes!

Look for more information on the application in Resources/Thematic.rtfd

Building/using the current editor requires the *latest* version of the
theme branch of the GUI from SVN.  The major task in theming is now
changing all the control drawing code to be themable ... identifying
a minimal set of drawing methods for each control and defining the 
number of tile images needed for each, and updating the code in the
GUI library.

To work on Thematic, you also need Gorm.app and ProjectCenter.app,
and a copy of an rtfd editor such as Ink.app if you wish to improve the
online help (Resources/Thematic.rtfd).
